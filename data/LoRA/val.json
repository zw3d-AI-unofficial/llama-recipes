It can be called during initialization of a GUI form or from the \"init_after\" callback function of an \"Options\" form. It is assumed the form has an option (integer) field \"idField\" that has a combo box widget. Any prior contents of the combo box list are discarded, and the combo box list is filled with the names of fonts currently available on the local computer. If \"Name\" is a non-empty string that matches the name of one of those fonts, that font becomes the default selection in the combo box. To apply this function to an \"Options\" form, input \"OptForm\" as the value of the \"Form\" argument. It is recommended that the form's field \"idField\" should reference the global variable \"VgRdTxtFont\" to hold the index of the selected item. This will synchronize the default font selection with the font selection fields in native ZW3D commands. This function updates \"VgRdTxtFont\" if a match to \"Name\" is found. If \"Name\" does not match any font name, the current value of \"VgRdTxtFont\" selects the default item in the combo box list. When working with an \"Options\" form, the usual practice for managing a font input field is to use an option field having a combo box for the font names, and to use a hidden text field in the form's data container to hold the name of the selected font. In the form's \"init_after\" callback, call this function with the contents of the hidden field as the \"Name\" argument. In the form's \"function\" callback, query the combo box for the text of the selected item, save the text to the hidden field, and use the text wherever the font name is needed. If the combo box cannot be queried because the \"Options\" form is not active (such as during regeneration), use whatever text was previously saved in the hidden field as the font name. For example, an \"init_after\" callback might include this snippet of code to initialize a font selection combo box in field 5, with a hidden text field 4 that might contain the name of a previously selected font (the data container is specified by \"idData\"). note: The font name will be an empty string if field 4 does not exist:\nForm GUI form name\nidField id of form field for font combo box\nName name of default font, may be NULL\nhasZwFont judge if fonts have ZW fonts.1:include ZW fonts,0:no ZW fonts\nevxErrors cvxFieldInitFont(const char *Form, int idField, const char *Name, int hasZwFont)"

Your objective may be to get the coordinates of a point that lies external to the active object (e.g. part), the pick-path of an external entity (e.g. an assembly face), or both. The selected point's coordinates are output in the local space of the point's parent entity. \"Matrix\" may be used to transform the point (and entity) coordinates from their local space to the space of the target object that was active at the time the point was selected (see cvxPntTransform(), cvxCrvTransform()and cvxSrfTransform()). If the point was selected by snapping to an entity, the pick-path of the entity is output via \"EntPath\". A pick-path defines the sequence of object references (i.e. nested assembly components) that locate the entity relative to the active target object. A pick-path could lead to an entity that lies in a different file or object than the active file/object. API functions for querying entities generally require that an entity's parent file and object(i.e. part, sketch, plan, drawing) be active.

The file browser is initialized using the parent folder of the file path from the active field. If the active field is empty, the file browser is initialized using the \"Default\" folder string. The specified \"Prompt\" is shown to the user when the file browser opens, and the browser displays the files specified by \"Filter\". Refer to cvxGetFile() for more information about the syntax of the \"Filter\" string. When the user closes the file browser, the path to the file selected by the user is sent to the active field. If the user cancels the browser, or if an error occurs, the active field is not changed. If \"Open = 1\", the file browser will be configured to select a file to be opened. If \"Open = 0\", the file browser will be configured to select or name a file to be saved. If the file already exists, the user will be asked to confirm that the file is to be replaced. A default will be provided if the \"Prompt\", \"Default\" or \"Filter\" argument is NULL. When \"Open\" is 1, the default filter allows any file to be selected, but when \"Open\" is 0 the caller should always provide the filter, although this function will use a default in this case, too, if necessary guessing at the type of file to be saved. When saving (\"Open\" is 0), the file browser can be configured to show a default folder and also pre-select a specified file. Do this by assigning the path to the desired folder to \"Default\", followed by a comma, followed by the desired file name. Unlike the cvxGetFile() function, this function does not allow multiple selections. Only a single file selection is sent to the active field when the user closes the file browser. This function is particularly helpful for implementing command functions that automatically display the file browser when the user activates a string input field. For example, a function that displays the file browser to open a text file might look like this: and after installing a symbol with the same name as the function, using the cvxCmdFunc() function, it can be referenced in the string field's options property by preceding the symbol name with a tilde character: ~TextFileCb, see: cvxGetFile().\nOpen 1 to open files, 0 to save files\nPrompt null-terminated text prompt\nDefault default directory (null-terminated string)\nFilter file filter (null-terminated string)\nvoid cvxGetFileActiveField(int Open, const char *Prompt, const char *Default, const char *Filter)"
