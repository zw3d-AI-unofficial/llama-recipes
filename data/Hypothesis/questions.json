This function is \n\n intended for use when initializing a form. It can be called during \n\n initialization of a GUI form or from the \"init_after\" callback \n\n function of an \"Options\" form.\nIt is assumed the form has an option (integer) field \"idField\" that \n\n has a combo box widget. Any prior contents of the combo box list are \n\n discarded, and the combo box list is filled with the names of fonts \n\n currently available on the local computer. If \"Name\" is a non-empty \n\n string that matches the name of one of those fonts, that font becomes \n\n the default selection in the combo box.\nTo apply this function to an \"Options\" form, input \"OptForm\" as the \n\n value of the \"Form\" argument.\nIt is recommended that the form's field \"idField\" should reference the \n\n global variable \"VgRdTxtFont\" to hold the index of the selected item. \n\n This will synchronize the default font selection with the font \n\n selection fields in native ZW3D commands. This function updates \n\n \"VgRdTxtFont\" if a match to \"Name\" is found. If \"Name\" does not match \n\n any font name, the current value of \"VgRdTxtFont\" selects the default \n\n item in the combo box list.\nWhen working with an \"Options\" form, the usual practice for managing a \n\n font input field is to use an option field having a combo box for the \n\n font names, and to use a hidden text field in the form's data \n\n container to hold the name of the selected font. In the form's \n\n \"init_after\" callback, call this function with the contents of the \n\n hidden field as the \"Name\" argument.
